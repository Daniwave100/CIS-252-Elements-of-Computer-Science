-- Write recursive implementations for all questions.

-- q1
-- Write a recursive implementation of capitalize, which takes
-- a String as input and returns a String with all chars
-- replaced by their uppercase version. Assume that the input
-- String contains a-z only.
-- Use the toUpper function from Data.Char.
capitalize :: String -> String
capitalize [] = ""

-- q2
-- Write a recursive implementation of replace1WithOne, which
-- takes a String as input and returns a String with all occurences
-- of the digit '1' replaced with the String "One".
-- Assume that the input String has only the chars a-z and 0-9.

-- q3
-- Write a recursive implementation of replaceDigitWithWord. This is
-- a generalization of q2, so any digit should be replaced with the
-- corresponding word. The correspoinding words are in the list subs,
-- in the correct position. So subs !! 0 is "Zero", subs !! 1 is "One"
-- and so on.
-- Assume that subs will always be correct, and s1 will only have the
-- chars a-z and 0-9.
-- For example: if Â s1 = "hello1there2" and
-- subs = ["Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
-- return "helloOnethereTwo"
-- The functions isDigit and digitToInt from Data.Char will be useful.

-- q6
-- Write a recursive implemenation of alternate, which produces one list
-- from alternate items from its two inputs.
-- For example, if lst1 = [1, 2, 3] and lst2 = [10, 11, 12] return
-- [1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 12]
-- If the input lists are not the same length, include all the elements
-- from the longer list at the end.
-- For example, if lst1 = [1, 2, 3] and lst2 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] return
-- [1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 12, 13, 14].

-- Write a recursive implementation of myZip, which returns a list of
-- tuples, with each tuple having one element from each input list. If

-- Insert x into the sorted lst1 so the result is still sorted.

-- For example, if x=3 and lst1 = [2, 7, 10], return [2, 3, 7, 10]

-- q9
-- Write a recursive implementation of merge, which assumes that both
-- its input lists are sorted, and combines them into one sorted list.
-- For example, if lst1 = [1, 4, 10] and lst2 = [0, 2, 7, 11, 12]
-- merge would return [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12]
--
-- If either input list is empty, just return the other list.
--
-- If neither input list is empty, compare the first element from
-- both lists. Using the example above, since 0 is less than 1, it
-- should go first. So, 0 should be added to result, and consed with
-- a recursive call to merge using (tail lst1) and lst2 as params.
--
-- There is a good solution which just uses recursive calls to merge.
-- In other words, you don't have to use any other functions from
-- this homework, or Data.Char etc.

-- q10
-- Insertion sort is an algorithm which builds up a sorted list from      read description on wiki. each step, take first item off of list and then insert it into whats left. If i split list into 7 and then 1, 2, 10, then i have to insert 7 into 1, 2, 10 which is a problem we already solved. call insert from back there.
-- an unsorted input list.
--
-- From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort:
-- At each step, the algorithm removes one element from the input data
-- finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it
-- there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
--
-- For example, if lst1 = [7, 1, 2, 10] the algorithm would start by
-- making an empty list, say result = [].
-- Next take the first element from lst1 and insert it into the correct
-- position in result. So lst1 is now [1, 2, 10] and result = [7].
-- Now repeat for 1, so lst1 = [2, 10] and result = [1, 7]
-- Repeat again for 2, so lst1 = [10] and result = [1, 2, 7]
-- Lastly, put 10 in the right place, so lst1 = [] and result = [1, 2, 7. 10]

-- Write a recursive implementation of insertion sort. There is a good
-- solution using recursive calls to insert (from q8) and iSort.
